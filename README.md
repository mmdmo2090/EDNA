EDNA is a project for an Undergraduate class: System Fundamentals (COMP 430)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


## Built With...
* Wooden Frame - Used Wainscoting Floor Molding for the front frame.
* Old Laptop Monitor - Found an old laptop that wasn't being used and pulled out LCD montior and attached it to an LCD Controller Board
* [HDMI LCD Controller Board](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NGZHVGA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) - Connects the LCD monitor the Raspberri Pi seamlessly with very little cables.
* [Raspberri Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) - Mounted in the back, operates as the main system and functionality of the device. This version of the Pi also has a wireless NIC intergrated so our code can constantly update itself. 
* [Red LED]() - Basic LED to simulate a notification or alert by blinking
* [IR Motion Sensor]() - Motion sensor that is programed to activate the screen when 'pressed'
